The purpose of IT instruction is check for the specified condition after IT then execute following instructions based on condition result.
We have various forms of IT instructions:
1. IT condition 
   instruction 1
Here instruction 1 is executed only if the condition specified above is true.

2.ITE condition 
  instruction 1
  instruction 2
Here instruction 1 is executed if condition is true else instruction 2 is executed.

IT instruction can take upto four instructions following it.Means ITTTT,ITTEE etc possible combinations of T and E . 

And also these four instructions must have specified its conditional part of thier syntax,Making them conditional instructions.These conditions can be logically same or inverse. 
If we look into the erroneous code :

ITTTE LT
MOV R3

We can see here the instruction here following IT is not conditional compared to 
ITTTE LT
ADDLT
MOVLT
MOVLT
SUBGE
where all the instructions after IT are conditional in execution.

This is the reason we got errors in above mentioned code.
